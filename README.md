# Contracts
A repository for informal contracts

This is simply a generic repository to put informal contracts. Whenever you and a friend/group of friends have an agreement, bet, deal, or anything of the sort, the best thing to do is to write the terms and conditions and ensure that all parties agree. This repository is just a way to achieve this using top notch technology, so you have access to the contract from anywhere, the signature is digital and every change or update is fully traceable!
